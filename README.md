# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
- There are two purposes for this analysis. The first purpose analyzes a data summary of sharing data by city type. The summary includes the number of rides, the number of drivers, total fares, and an average fare per ride and driver. The second purpose is to create a multiple-line graph that shows total fares for each week in the data range 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-28 by city type.


## Results

- Dataframe summary by city type

    - Dataframe summary shows Urban cities have high total rides, drivers, and fares, however, if we're looking at the average fare per ride and driver, we can see that the fare was the least. Rural cities have the least total of rides and drivers, but the average fare per ride was the highest at $34.62 compared to the other two. And average fare per driver is also the highest at $55.49. The summary concludes that ride fares are lower as close to urban cities, and are higher as close to rural cities.

- Multiple-line graph for each week by city type
    - It is easily shown that Urban earns more than other city types in 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-28. According to the data frame summary above, the reason urban cities have higher total fares is that have the highest number of rides and drivers. The graph also shows that there is the highest point on each city line at the end of February, this could mean that there is more consumer who chose to ride at this time.

## Summary

- When we're looking at the data frame summary, we can see that ride fares are much higher in rural cities. There could be various reasons for this, in the summary, we can see that not many drivers choose to work in rural cities. Therefore, one of the reasons is rural cities have a shortage driver working in rural cities. The shortage will make the price increase and the surplus will make the price decrease. 

- The other reason could be fare was depends on the distance of the ride. Urban cities mostly have higher populations and higher convenience on traveling, therefore, people in urban cities have more options on travel the city such as city transit, subway, bus, etc. Rural cities have fewer options, so the distance of each ride could be longer. In addition to the second reason, urban cities having a higher population could also mean higher work opportunities for drivers receiving orders.

- Here are three recommendations I come up with that might help balance the fares between city types.
    1. Work with rural cities governments that provide more job opportunities in rural and suburban cities. As the increase of job opportunities, population increase, and demand for drivers will be increased. 
    2. Increase advertisement in rural cities to help increase the number of rides. 
    3. We have a higher demand for rides in urban cities, we can adjust the price of rides in the different time slots. For example, increase the price of rides during periods of high demand and midnight. Then providing discounts for rides in a period of low demand.
