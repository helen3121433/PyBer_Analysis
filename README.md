# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
There are two purpose for this analysis. First purpose analyze a data summary of sharing data by city type. The sumamry includes number of rides, number for drivers, total fares, and average of fare per each rides and driver. Second purpose is create a multiple-line grath that shows total fares for each week in data range 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-28 by city type.


## Results

- Dataframe summary by city type

    - Dataframe summary shows that Urban has high total rides, drivers and fares, however if we're looking on average fare per ride and driver, we can see that the fare was least. Rural has least total of rides and drivers, but average fare per ride was the highest as $34.62 compares to the other two. And average fare per driver also the highest as $55.49. The summary conclues that ride fares are lower as close to urban cities, and are higher as close to rural cities. 

- Multiple-line graph for each week by city type
    - It is easily shows that Urban earns more than other city types in 2019-01-01 thourhg 2019-04-28. According to the dataframe summary above, the reasons urban cities has higher total fares because has highest number of rides and drivers. 
    - The graph also shows that there is a highest point on each city line at the end of Feburary, this coule means that there are more consumer chose to ride at this time. 

## Summary

- When we're looking at the dataframe summary, we can that ride fare are much higher in rural cities. There could be various reason for this, in the sumamry we can see that not many driver are choose to work in rural cities. Therefore, one of the reason is because have shortage driver working in rural cities. Shortage will makes price increase and surplus will makes price decrease. 

- The other reason could be fare was depends on distance of ride. Urban cities are mostly have higher populations and higher convenience on traveling, therefore, people in urban cities has more option on travel the city such as city transit, subway, bus, etc. Rural cities has less options, so the distance of each ride could longer. Addtion to second reason, urban cities has higher population could also means higher work opporunities for drivers receiving orders. 

- Here's three recommendations I comes with that might help balance the fares between city types.
    1. Work with cities governments that provides more job oppotunities in rural and suburban cties. As increase of job oppotunties, population increase, and demand for driver will be increase.
    2.
